# Microblog using REACT and a fake REST API using JSON SERVER

When you load the project in your VS CODE, you must run: 
### `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`
This way, you have the fake REST API running. 

## Features of 'Your Microblog':

- You have a 'loading...' message while the JSON file is being loaded into the app, to make it more realistic.
